        <p>
          I am a Graduate in Physics, working closely with web technologies. My goal today is becoming a web developer
          and have been working towards it in my spare time for the last year.
          I am 100% positive I will reach it and I believe it can only be done via hard work and dedication.
          So far I have concentrated my efforts in learning Javascript web stack.<br><br>
          Some qualities that may, at least I think, make me stand out of the crowd: transparency, extremely
          fast learner and BS-free
          attitude. <br><br>
